"""
Submodule with functions to call Praat commands and run Praat scripts.

In addition to the Python interface provided in the top-level `parselmouth`
module, this module provides a Python interface to access any Praat
command or action through the `parselmouth.praat.call` function from
Python. Moreover, existing Praat scripts can be run through the
`parselmouth.praat.run` and `parselmouth.praat.run_file` functions.

.. note::
    Any command or script accessing the graphical user interface or other
    interactive functionality of Praat will not work, since the internal
    Praat source is in Parselmouth is run in *batch mode*. This is similar
    to running a Praat script from the command line (see
    :praat:`Scripting 6.9. Calling from the command line`).

    Call a Praat command.
    
    This function provides a Python interface to call available Praat commands
    based on the label in the Praat user interface and documentation, similar
    to the Praat scripting language.
    
    Calling a Praat command through this function roughly corresponds to the
    following scenario in the Praat user interface or scripting language:
    
    1. Zero, one, or multiple `parselmouth.Data` objects are put into Praat's
       global object list and are 'selected'.
    2. The Python argument values are converted into Praat values; see below.
    3. The Praat command is executed on the selected objects with the converted
       values as arguments.
    4. The result of the command is returned. The type of the result depends on
       the result of the Praat command; see below.
    5. Praat's object list is emptied again, such that a future execution of
       this function is independent from the current call.
    
    The use of `call` is demonstrated in the `Pitch manipulation and Praat
    commands <../examples/pitch_manipulation.ipynb>`_ example.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    object : parselmouth.Data
        A single object to add to the Praat object list, which will be selected
        when the Praat command is called.
    objects : List[parselmouth.Data]
        Multiple objects to be added to the Praat object list, which will be
        selected when the Praat command is called.
    command : str
        The Praat action to call. This is the same command name as one would
        use in a Praat script and corresponds to the label on the button in
        the Praat user interface.
    *args
        The list of values to be passed as arguments to the Praat command.
        Allowed types for these arguments are:
    
        - `int` or `float`: passed as a Praat numeric value
        - `bool`: converted into ``"yes"``/``"no"``
        - `str`: passed as Praat string value
        - `numpy.ndarray`: passed as Praat vector or matrix, if the array
          contains numeric values and is 1D or 2D, respectively.
    
    Keyword Arguments
    -----------------
    extra_objects : List[parselmouth.Data]
        Extra objects added to the Praat object list that will not be selected
        when the command is called (default value: ``[]``).
    return_string : bool
        Return the raw string written in the Praat info window instead of the
        converted Python object (default value: ``False``).
    
    Returns
    -------
    object
        The result of the Praat command. The actual value returned depends on
        what the Praat command does. The following types can be returned:
    
        - If ``return_string=True`` was passed, a `str` value is returned,
          which contains the text that would have been written to the Praat
          info window.
        - A `float`, `int`, `bool`, or `complex` value is returned when the
          Praat command would write such a value to the Praat info window.
        - A `numpy.ndarray` value is returned if the command returns a Praat
          vector or matrix.
        - A `parselmouth.Data` object is returned if the command always creates
          exactly one object. If the actual type of the Praat object is
          available in Parselmouth, an object of a subtype of
          `parselmouth.Data` is returned.
        - A list of `parselmouth.Data` objects is returned if the command can
          create multiple new objects (even if this particular execution of the
          command only added one object to the Praat object list).
        - A `str` is returned when a string or info text would be written to
          the Praat info window.

    run(objects: List[parselmouth.Data], script: str, *args, **kwargs) -> object
    
    Run a Praat script.
    
    Given a string with the contents of a Praat script, run this script as if
    it was run inside Praat itself. Similarly to `parselmouth.praat.call`,
    Parselmouth objects and Python argument values can be passed into the
    script.
    
    Calling this function roughly corresponds to the following sequence of
    steps in Praat:
    
    1. Zero, one, or multiple `parselmouth.Data` objects are put into Praat's
       global object list and are 'selected'.
    2. The Python argument values are converted into Praat values; see `call`.
    3. The Praat script is opened and run with the converted values as
       arguments; see :praat:`Scripting 6.1. Arguments to the script`.
    4. The results of the execution of the script are returned; see below.
    5. Praat's object list is emptied again, such that a future execution of
       this function is independent from the current call.
    
    Note that the script will be run in Praat's so-called 'batch' mode; see
    :praat:`Scripting 6.9. Calling from the command line`. Since the script is
    run from inside a Python program, the Praat functionality is run without
    graphical user interface and no windows (such as *"View & Edit"*) can be
    opened by the Praat script. However, the functionality in these windows is
    also available in different ways: for example, opening a *Sound* object in
    a *"View & Edit"* window, making a selection, and choosing *"Extract
    selected sound (windowed)..."* can also be achieved by directly using the
    *"Extract part..."* command of the *Sound* object.
    
    Arguments
    ---------
    object : parselmouth.Data
        A single object to add to the Praat object list, which will be selected
        when the Praat script is run.
    objects : List[parselmouth.Data]
        Multiple objects to be added to the Praat object list, which will be
        selected when the Praat script is run.
    script : str
        The content of the Praat script to be run.
    *args
        The list of values to be passed as arguments to the Praat script. For
        more details on the allowed types of these argument, see `call`.
    
    Keyword arguments
    -----------------
    extra_objects : List[parselmouth.Data]
        Extra objects added to the Praat object list that will not be selected
        when the command is called (default value: ``[]``).
    capture_output : bool
        Intercept and also return the output written to the Praat info window,
        instead of forwarding it to the Python standard output; see below
        (default value: ``False``).
    return_variables : bool
        Also return a `dict` of the Praat variables and their values at the
        end of the script's execution; see below (default value: ``False``).
    
    Returns
    -------
    object
        A list of `parselmouth.Data` objects selected at the end of the
        script's execution.
    
        Optionally, extra values are returned:
    
        - A `str` containing the intercepted output if ``capture_output=True``
          was passed.
        - A `dict` mapping variable names (`str`) to their values (`object`)
          if ``return_variables`` is ``True``. The values of Praat's variables
          get converted to Python values:
    
          - A Praat string variable, with a name ending in ``$``, is returned
            as `str` value.
          - A Praat vector or matrix variable, respectively ending in ``#`` or
            ``##``, is returned as `numpy.ndarray`.
          - A numeric variable, without variable name suffix, is converted to
            a Python `float`.

    run_file(objects: List[parselmouth.Data], path: str, *args, **kwargs) -> object
    
    Run a Praat script from file.
    
    Given the filename of a Praat script, the script is read and run the same
    way as a script string passed to `parselmouth.praat.run`. See `run` for
    details on the manner in which the script gets executed.
    
    One thing to note is that relative filenames in the Praat script
    (including those in potential 'include' statements in the script; see
    :praat:`Scripting 5.8. Including other scripts`) will be resolved relative
    to the path of the script file, just like in Praat. Also note that Praat
    accomplishes this by temporarily changing the current working during the
    execution of the script.
    
    Arguments
    ---------
    object : parselmouth.Data
        A single object to add to the Praat object list, which will be selected
        when the Praat script is run.
    objects : List[parselmouth.Data]
        Multiple objects to be added to the Praat object list, which will be
        selected when the Praat script is run.
    path : str
        The filename of the Praat script to run.
    *args
        The list of values to be passed as arguments to the Praat script. For
        more details on the allowed types of these argument, see `call`.
    
    Keyword arguments
    -----------------
    keep_cwd : bool
        Keep the current working directory (see `os.getcwd`) when running the
        script, rather than changing it to the script's parent directory, as
        Praat does by default (default value: ``False``). Note that even when
        set to ``True``, the filenames in the Praat script's include statements
        will be resolved relatively to the directory containing the script.
    **kwargs
        See `parselmouth.praat.run`.
    
    Returns
